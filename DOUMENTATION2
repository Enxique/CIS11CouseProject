We tried to implement the program in a way where the 5 inputs are handled through a loop mimicking a for loop in C/C++. 
However, due to time constraints we were only able to successfully display the input message five times and store scores in array.

Programs biggest limitation is it's incabability to input a 3 digit value of 100.

Program is able to input 5 scores in a loop, however we only get an infinite loop.
